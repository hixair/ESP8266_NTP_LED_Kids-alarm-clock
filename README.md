# ESP8266_NTP_LED_Kids-alarm-clock
A visual clock that lights up when it is ok to wakeup. 
Made from a cheap esp8266 dev board and an old rabbit lamp toy. 
Cost is minimal (5€) compared to some commercial product you can find on amazon (25-50€). 




Todo : 

~- Blink leds until wifi is connected and NTP time aquired.~

There are several good NTP librairies and i used the one from : https://github.com/arduino-libraries/NTPClient .
